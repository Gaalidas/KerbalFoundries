Kebal Foundries gravity repulsor:

REALEASE NOTES:

ALPHA VERSION, NOT FOR REDISTRIBUTION!

Ride height, spring rate and damper settings are tweakable in the VAB/SPH via tweakables. Ride height is adjustable in-flight by setting the desired height using the slider, then retracting and re-deploying the repulsors.

Enjoy :)
